# 2. Component and Storybook structure

Date: 2022-03-06

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to structure our components and the storybook.

## Decision

We will use a structure inspired by the sidebar navigation of [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/getting-started) docs.

## Considered Alternatives

[Atomic Design by Brad Frost](https://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/)

## Consequences

- Components and stories are categorized and bundled by context rather than size.
- Component library stays easy to navigate while the project scales.
