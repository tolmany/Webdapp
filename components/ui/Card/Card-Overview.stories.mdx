# Card

Cards are surfaces that display content and actions on a single topic.  
They should be easy to scan for relevant and actionable information. Elements, like text and images, should be placed on them in a way that clearly indicates hierarchy.

## Import

```tsx
import { Card } from 'components/ui';
```

## Usage

<Preview withSource="none">
  <Story id="layout-card--visual-guide" />
</Preview>

```tsx
<Card>...</Card>
```

Cards don't have a default padding, however, they have a border-radius of 1.5rem (24px), which is why you should usually add padding of at least 1.5rem (`p-6`) to either the Card or the content so it won't look weird.  
For example:

```tsx
<Card className="p-6">...</Card>
```

or

```tsx
<Card>
  <p className="p-6">...</p>
</Card>
```
